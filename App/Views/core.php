            <p>Tempus Project core is a php library that uses htaccess routing and the MVC architecture to drive web applications in PHP. Tempus Project Core is maintained in conjunction with The Tempus Project. At this time it is not intended for stand alone use. There are plans in the near future to change this though it is not a top priority.</p>
            <p>Currently the documentation for Tempus Project Core is top secret! Na, but really though its still 404. We appreciate your patience, please check back soon.</p>
