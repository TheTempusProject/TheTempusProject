- prefer the use of [] for arrays over array()
- All functions must be documented with the exception of controller methods (see [Documentation](#documentation) Section)
- Controller methods may be doc-blocked when necessary for clarity (see [Documentation](#documentation) Section)
- All new Classes must include a class level doc-block (see [Documentation](#documentation) Section)
- Any new dependencies will have a longer validation process and should be accompanied by the required information (see [Dependencies](#dependencies) Section)

## Naming Conventions
- File names are to be lower case
- All class names must be upper case
- Any data being stored as a file must be saved in the app directory (with the exception of config which should be stored unde config/)
- Controllers must have a constructor and destructor using the constructor and destructor methods found in resources/
- Views must be named using lowerCamelCase

## Dependencies
Whenever a dependency is updated or added, pull requests must include a section that answers the following questions.
- Why is this dependency required
- Could this be reasonably accomplished within the app by implementing new features in a later version? explain.
- What is the latest stable version that can be used
- What features are absolutely necessary for your feature or modification to work
