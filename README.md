# The Tempus Project
#### Rapid Prototyping Framework
###### Developer: Joey Kimsey

**Notice: This code is in _no way production ready_!!! This framework is provided as is, so use at your own risk.**

The aim of this project is to provide a very simple and stable platform from which to easily add functionality and build applications suited for your needs.

Currently I am in the process of testing all the systems in preparation for the first production ready release.

## Installation

Preferred method for installation is using composer.
1. Clone the directory to wherever you want the framework
2. Open your terminal to the directory you have cloned the repository and install using composer:
`php composer.phar install`
Included with this repository is an install.php file. You simply: 
3. Open your browser and navigate to install.php (it will be in the root directory)
4. Fill out the form fields and click submit
5. If everything was successful, you should be good to go.

If you would like a full copy of the project with all of its included dependencies you can find it at http://www.github.com/joeyk4816/TheTempusProjectComplete
Please note this repository is always up to the latest _stable_ release.

If any errors occur with installation you can delete the settings file App/settings.php and try again.

**Do not forget to remove install.php once you have finished installation!**
